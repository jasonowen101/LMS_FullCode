To make the Library Management System completely operable and able to run in VSCode, 
you'll need to consider additional code and items. Here's a step-by-step checklist:

Package Structure:

Organize your classes into packages. Typically, you might have packages like library, ui, and others.
Create package directories and move your classes accordingly.



File Handling (Optional):

Implement file handling for persistent data storage. This might include saving and loading book/user/transaction data to and from files.
Utilize Java's ObjectOutputStream and ObjectInputStream or other file handling mechanisms.


Exception Handling:

Implement exception handling to handle potential runtime errors gracefully.
Consider using try-catch blocks to handle exceptions in critical areas, such as user input parsing or file operations.
User Input Validation:

Enhance user input validation to ensure the correctness and integrity of data.
Validate user inputs for data types, ranges, and constraints.


Graphical User Interface:

If you want to move beyond the command line, consider implementing a graphical user interface (GUI) using Swing or JavaFX.
Create GUI components for adding books, updating user information, and handling transactions.


Build Tool Integration:

Integrate a build tool like Maven or Gradle to manage dependencies and build your project easily.


Testing:

Write unit tests for your classes and methods using testing frameworks like JUnit.
Test various scenarios to ensure the robustness of your system.


Documentation:

Add comprehensive documentation to your code using Javadoc or similar documentation tools.
Document the purpose and usage of each class, method, and variable.


User Authentication and Authorization (Optional):

Implement user authentication for librarians and potentially for regular users.
Include authorization checks to ensure that only authorized users can perform certain actions.


User Feedback and Messages:

Provide meaningful and user-friendly feedback messages to guide users through the system.
Display informative messages for success, errors, and warnings.
Localization (Optional):



Additional Features:

Depending on the specific requirements, add any additional features like book reservations, 
multiple copies of the same book, user history, etc.



Refactoring:

Periodically review and refactor your code to improve its readability, maintainability, and performance.



Code Comments and Cleanup:

Ensure that your code has sufficient comments explaining its functionality.
Remove any unnecessary or commented-out code.



User Manuals:

Create user manuals or documentation that guides librarians and users on how to use the system.
